bio: <strong>André Pinto</strong> is a Data Scientist / Software Engineer for Sepio, focused on providing a platform for full network visibility and asset risk management. André has a master's in Biomedical Engineering and he's been an organizer at DLSPT since 2021. He is a sucker for almost any sport, so in my free time he spend most time doing sports or watching them on TV. Also kind of a book worm.
