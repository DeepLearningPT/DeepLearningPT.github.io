bio: I am André Pinto and I am working right now as a Data Scientist / Software Engineer for Sepio. We're focused on providing a platform for full network visibility and asset risk management. I have a master's in Biomedical Engineering and I've been an organizer at DLSPT since 2021. I am sucker for almost any sport, so in my free time I spend most time doing sports or watching them on tv. Also kind of a book worm.
